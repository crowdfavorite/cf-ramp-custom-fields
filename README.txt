Adds the ability to select which custom fields represent a post mapping and adds them to the batch.

== Installation ==

This plugin requires [RAMP](http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/) to function.

Upload it to the plugins directory and activate it through the Plugins menu.

== Developers ==

The meta key selection form is generated by all available meta keys. The `ramp_mm_available_keys` filter allows additional meta keys to be filtered in for wildcard and regualar expression matching.

`{%s}` for strings and `{%d}` for integers can be used for wildcard matching. For example `_ramp_{%d}_key` will match `_ramp_10_key` and `_ramp_4_key` but not `_ramp_ten_key`, this would need the string wildcard: `_ramp_{%s}_key`. Regular Expressions are also supported and must start and end with `/`. Example: `/_ramp_[0-9]_key/` would match `_ramp_4_key` and `_ramp_8_key` but not `_ramp_10_key`.

Specific meta keys can be excluded from being selected via the `ramp_mm_excluded_keys` filter.
